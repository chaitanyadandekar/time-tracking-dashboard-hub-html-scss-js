## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS using SCSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throught the project I have made sure that I use semantic markups, but they have been used in only 1 or 2 places. This is my very first SCSS project and the experience was chaotic but enjoyable. Towards the end I really got to know the perks of SCSS over basic CSS syntax.

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML - Going to work on this alot.
- Explore SCSS - Future projects will inclue scss.
- JavaScript - Need to work on js and try to use its libraries.
- Backend - Try to include backend in upcoming projects.

### Useful resources

## Development

All the npm packages are Dev dependencies. You dont even need them while running your project. If you want to develop this project and customize it for your own needs then download them. The Gulp file Provided will help you set-up a live server.

- To download the dev packages go to the root directory (In which README.md is present in this case) and type in your console/shell/terminal:

```shell
foo@bar:~/../your_directory$ npm install --only=dev
```

- Make sure you have node and npm installed
